This is the web interface for providers. It should boast security + ease. Also the front facing part of our server. The backend (located at promopass.root.sx) is important for our mobile app to grab data from.

## Getting Started

### Todo
* Add an edit profile for providers to add their businesses/gimbal devices to
* Add create ad functionality
* Configure google/facebook buttons on login/sign up page.

#### Maybe
* Restful API would be nice -- but really low on the priority list. :( 
*
